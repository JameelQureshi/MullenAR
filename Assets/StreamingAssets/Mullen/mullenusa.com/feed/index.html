			<p><strong>BREA, Calif. (August 12, 2019)</strong> &#8211; This weekend, Mullen USA makes its inaugural appearance at Pebble Beach Car Weekend with the brand’s first vehicle, the Qiantu K50 &#8211; a striking electric sports car that Mullen will homologate, assemble and sell in North America. Against the backdrop of ultimate automotive luxury, the Mullen brand’s debut at this exclusive event furthers its unique position in the fast-growing EV segment.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be amongst car enthusiasts who are passionate about historical brands and open to considering a completely new one,” said David Michery, CEO of Mullen USA. “Our K50 is a stunning car that looks at home amongst other premium luxury brands.”</p>
<p>The K50’s luxury appointments, within and outside the vehicle, make it stand out in a crowded field. The body features an all-aluminum frame with custom carbon-fiber panels that are painted separately. Pirelli high-performance sports tires envelop 19-inch aluminum alloy wheels, outfitted with Brembo high performance brake calipers. A comprehensive LED lighting system helps to lead the way.</p>
<p>Inside, the vehicle boasts high-quality leather and Alcantara sports seats that are roomy enough for an NBA player. A heated leather steering wheel and seven-color ambient light scheme throughout can make the K50 connected and comfortable for the driver. A 15.6-inch HD touchscreen completes the vehicle’s premium interior.</p>
<p>In a premium electric vehicle, the hidden supporting actor is efficiency, which allows for high-quality touches like those found in the K50. Even with its focus on efficiency over performance, the K50 boasts a 430-horsepower motor and 250 miles of range. A higher performance package will be an option for the U.S. market for interested customers.</p>
<p>Mullen is taking reservations for the first round of production vehicles, dubbed the Signature Series, which will be delivered in late 2020. Please visit Mullen on the Entrance Lawn near the 1st Tee Archway to learn more and experience the K50 during the 2019 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance.</p>

<p><strong>Mullen Technolgies Indy 500 TV Ad Breaks The Internet</strong></p>
<p>Mullen Technologies’ Indy 500 TV ad for the K50 electric sports car during the popular Indianapolis 500 telecast drew so much attention, that for a brief moment the MullenUSA.com website crashed due to the overwhelming number of people eager to find out more about the K50.</p>
<p>Mullen ran advertising before and during 103rd running of the Indianapolis 500, the premier event of the IndyCar Series, held on Sunday, May 26, 2019 in Indianapolis, IN. Indy 500 race fans got to see a Mullen K50 blimp throughout the race weekend, leading up to the main event on Sunday. Mullen K50 commercials were televised live throughout the actual race on Sunday.</p>
<p>“The Indy 500 is the epitome of speed and performance in American racing and the perfect place for Mullen to further introduce the public to our electric supercar, the K50,” says Mullen Founder &amp; CEO, David Michery. “I’ve grown up watching the Indy 500 over Memorial Day Weekends. It’s been part of our family tradition for many years. I’m very proud to be an advertiser and broadcast sponsor of the Indy 500 and to showcase to the K50 to racing fans and consumers around the world. I never imagined that we would crash the site from the overwhelming response. We had safeguards in place to prevent this from happening and even our backup plans were overwhelmed for a minute or two. We fielded inquiries from all over the world for the K50 on race day. We continue to see very strong interest throughout the entire holiday weekend.”</p>

			<p>April 29th, 2019 &#8211; Brea, California, USA</p>
<p><strong>Mullen Technologies To Produce Qiantu K50 In Washington State</strong></p>
<p>Fresh off a successful showing at the 2019 New York International Auto Show,  <a href="http://mullenusa.com/">Mullen Technologies</a>, a new American electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, has chosen the Spokane region of Washington state to produce the Qiantu K50 – the company’s flagship sports coupe. Mullen and the West Plains Airport Area Public Development Authority (PDA) have signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the construction of 1.3 million square feet of assembly, manufacturing, and research and development facilities in the Spokane region of Washington state.</p>
<p><em>“We are thrilled to be finalizing this critical first step in bringing the Qiantu K50 by Mullen to North America,” </em>says David Michery, Mullen Founder &amp; CEO. <em>“The response to the vehicle at the New York Auto Show was incredible and we can’t wait to get positive feedback once people actually drive this beautiful EV.”</em></p>
<p>Mullen Technologies is working with the PDA to develop and produce its Qiantu K50 pure electric sports car in Spokane County with approximately 55 jobs at startup, increasing to 863 jobs by 2026. The company, through Mullen Energy, has a further interest in bringing its battery research and development of lithium batteries for its autos and other uses which would increase the job count to nearly 3,000. Over the next two years, Mullen will be developing an air handling system to optimize the battery cell life.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about the LOI with Mullen,” said Larry Krauter, Chair of the PDA and CEO of Spokane International Airport. “This is exactly why we created the Public Development Authority, to attract innovative companies to the region who create well-paying jobs so we can make up the income disparity with the rest of Washington. This is the role our community leaders envisioned for the PDA and the LOI is another example of our efforts to deliver on that vision.”</p>
<p>The PDA would construct the facilities, including site improvements and rail access, and lease the facilities to Mullen. The PDA is currently working with Mullen to secure an interim facility of approximately 100,000 square feet for their immediate use for the battery research and development, production and initial assembly of the sports car.</p>
<p>The Qiantu K50 by Mullen will hit North American roads in the second half of 2020. The pure electric high-performance sports car is capable of 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds, 125 mph maximum speed (electronically limited) and a range of approximately 200 miles. With the innovation Mullen Energy has underway the lithium batteries powering the sports car would be 30% lighter and would significantly increase the overall range of the vehicle. <em>The stunning design paired with two motors generating 430-horsepower forms a truly unique vehicle primed for the exciting electrified future of the automobile. </em></p>

<p>Mullen Technologies is pleased to announce the North American Debut of the Qiantu (meaning “Future” in Chinese) K50 at the New York Auto Show in April. This past December, Mullen Technologies and Qiantu announced a cooperation agreement, which allows Mullen to homologate, assemble and sell the vehicle in North America. </p>
<p>First held in 1900, the New York International Auto Show is one of the oldest vehicle exhibitions in the world.

<p>The K50 is Qiantu’s flagship model and combines a powerful 296kW/402 HP engine mounted on an all-aluminum frame with an aerodynamic carbon fiber design that combines lighter weight and a stronger downforce for optimal performance and handling.</p>
<p>This car is not just about the power. Flowing lines and sharp contours give the Qiantu K50 a distinctive style and ethereal beauty. The sculpted carbon-fiber body adds a futuristic element and is available in 6 colors.</p>
<p><em>“The New York Auto Show is the perfect place to introduce this amazing car to North America,” </em>says Mullen Founder &amp; CEO David Michery. <em>“I wanted to bring it to consumers in the United States, where there’s always room for a car that combines power, beauty, and performance with zero CO2 emissions.”</em></p>
<p>Additional K50s are arriving at Mullen R&amp;D center, where diagnostic and battery testing as well as homologation process will begin. The K50 will be manufactured in North America with deliveries of first orders set for 2020. </p>
